# Convolutional-Autoencoder-Neural-Network

A convolutional autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture that is used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which are composed of convolutional layers. The encoder compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder then reconstructs the image from this representation. Convolutional autoencoders are particularly useful for image data, as they can learn to extract features that are spatially localized.

## Extension

Use of Encoder for image classification

Experiment with number of convolutional layers, filter size, filters per layer, number of epochs, batch size.

Use the encoder layers of the autoencoder, connected with a fully connected layer and an output layer in order to classify images
